here is a list of useful pages. at the bottom of this page should be a navigable graph of all the links to the various pages.

note that i make pages rapidly and am missing practically everything. if you would like me to add a specific page or make changes about a specific page, please text or email me. i have considered making a public wiki (like on miraheze), but that would be more complication than i desire at the moment. --b
